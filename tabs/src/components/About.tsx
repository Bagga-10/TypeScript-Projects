          About Syed
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          My name is Syed Farhan, a dedicated web developer currently pursuing
          my studies in Hyderabad. With a strong foundation in front-end and
          back-end technologies, I am passionate about creating clean,
          efficient, and user-friendly web applications. I continuously seek to
          expand my skills through hands-on projects and ongoing learning.
          Beyond development, I enjoy reading books that broaden my perspective,
          coding as both a discipline and a hobby, and playing football to stay
          active and focused. I pride myself on being self-motivated and
          committed to delivering high-quality results in every task I
          undertake.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
          As a web developer, I am particularly interested in building scalable
          digital solutions that solve real-world problems. I enjoy
          collaborating with others, learning from feedback, and embracing new
          challenges that push me to grow. My goal is to contribute to impactful
          projects while continually advancing my technical and creative
          abilities in the ever-evolving world of web development.
